# Klondike, a Fedora Remix.

### What it is:
Klondike is a lightly customized version of Fedora Linux created to fill the gap of Fedora KDE Spin users once KDE Plasma 6 lands lacking downstream Xorg session support. Klondike intends to exist at least as long as the Xorg session is supported by KDE upstream.

One core goal is to also build the means to take up the slack for the remaining life of KDE 6 after that if possible. To be clear, this remix is in no way designed to justify or dispute the decision of the Fedora KDE SIG to pre-emptively stop supporting the Xorg session for KDE despite KDE upstream not *yet* dropping support. However, it is highly anticipated that will happen mid-stream, no doubt, causing disruptions to users, packagers, and distros alike.

Another is to assist in connecting users to those whom can best help get their Wayland issues accounted for and resolved while still enjoying KDE on Fedora in the meantime.

The last (for now) is to have a lighter default selection of system and KDE components as well as some default configuration changes toward that focus.

Otherwise, it's KDE on Fedora just plan to come here before bothering Fedora flora to be sure it isn't something unique to Klondike.

### What it is **NOT**:
- Just identical to the Fedora KDE Sig configuration with the relevant components re-added.
- An excuse to ignore wayland and the issues you are facing using it.
- Zero effort for sole gain.

### Changes from the Fedora KDE SIG:
- TBA

### Current Status:
- Prototyping the kickstart
