# Klondike, a Fedora Remix.

### What it is:
Klondike is a lightly customized version of Fedora Linux created to fill the gap of Fedora KDE Spin users once KDE Plasma 6 lands lacking downstream Xorg session support as long as it is supported by KDE upstream and to build the means to compensate after that point for the remaining life of KDE 6 if possible.

### What it is **NOT**:
- This remix is in no way designed to justify or dispute the decision of the Fedora KDE SIG to pre-emptively stop supporting the Xorg session for KDE despite KDE upstream not *yet* dropping support. However, it is highly anticipated that will happen mid-stream, no doubt, ausing disruptions to users so dependant and providers alike.
- Just identical to the Fedora KDE Sig configuration with the relevant components re-added.
- An excuse to ignore wayland and the issues you are facing using it.
- Zero effort for one's sole gain.

### Changes from the Fedora KDE SIG:
- TBA

### Current Status:
- Prototyping the kickstart
