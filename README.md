# Klondike, a Fedora Remix.

### What it is:
Klondike is a lightly customized version of Fedora Linux created to fill the gap of Fedora KDE Spin users once KDE Plasma 6 lands lacking downstream Xorg session support. Klondike intends to exist at least as long as the Xorg session is supported by KDE upstream. As well, it is a core goal to build the means to take up the slack for the remaining life of KDE 6 after that if possible.

Another core goal is to help connect users to those whom can best help get their Wayland issues resolved while still enjoying KDE on Fedora in the meantime. To be clear, this remix is in no way designed to justify or dispute the decision of the Fedora KDE SIG to pre-emptively stop supporting the Xorg session for KDE despite KDE upstream not *yet* dropping support. However, it is highly anticipated that will happen mid-stream, no doubt, causing disruptions to users, packagers, and distros.

### What it is **NOT**:
- Just identical to the Fedora KDE Sig configuration with the relevant components re-added.
- An excuse to ignore wayland and the issues you are facing using it.
- Zero effort for sole gain.

### Changes from the Fedora KDE SIG:
- TBA

### Current Status:
- Prototyping the kickstart
